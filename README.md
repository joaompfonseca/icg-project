# ICG Project - Solarmax 3D

## Description

Solarmax 3D (heavily inspired on the original 2D version Solarmax) is a space-themed strategy game where players are in charge of building a fleet of spaceships that are able attack and defend planets on the map. The objective of the game is to colonize all the planets in the map, making sure the enemy is completely eliminated in the process. Players must strategically deploy the spaceships to destroy the enemy’s fleet and eventually colonize their planets; while also making sure they are able to defend from attacks.

The main purpose of this application is to demonstrate the use of the JavaScript Three.js library, which allows the representation of 3D graphics over a web browser. Most features from the library were addressed in ICG classes, while other more complex ones had to be researched using online documentation (e.g. OutlinePass and Raycaster for highlighting the planets).

**Deployment:** [Solarmax 3D @ GitHub](https://joaompfonseca.github.io/icg-project/)

**Course:** Introduction to Computer Grahpics (2022/2023).
